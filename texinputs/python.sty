% BUGS:
% 1. If anything gets send to stderr then it should be included
% in \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim} to be properly displayed
%
% \immediate\write18{cat \@pythoninclude\space\jobname.py | python > \jobname.py.out 2>\jobname.py.err}
%
% 2. Watch out for indentation done by aucTeX in Emacs
%
% 3. Let the package accept a "final version" option, such
% that the output of each python run is saved such that it can be
% inserted into the document by hand 
% (conference, journals are not likely to compile with
% shell_escape or have python).
%
% 4. Somehow cache the output for each \begin{python}...\end{python}
% and reuse the cached version if it has not changed.
% Perhaps dangerous if the included python script has changed
% but we would check for that as well.
