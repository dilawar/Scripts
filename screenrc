##   Keybindings   ##
# F7='k7', F8='k8', F9='k9', F10='k;', F11='F1', F12='F2'
# Good things to bind to hotkeys:
#  prev (go to previous screen)
#  next (go to next screen)
#  kill (kill this window)
#  screen (create a new window)
#  title (rename the current window)
#  detach (detach this session from this terminal)
