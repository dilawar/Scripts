__Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of gls{camkii} ring__

Upon its influx into spine, \gls{ca} binds to \gls{cam} to form \gls{cacam}
complex.
The first step in \gls{camkii} activation requires simultaneous binding of two
\gls{cacam} to two adjacent subunits of \gls{camkii}. The probability of
simultaneous binding of two \gls{cacam} is very low at basal calcium
concentration. Once a subunit is phosphorylated, it phosphorylates its
neighbouring subunit (\emph{autophosphorylation}). Auto-phosphorylation requires
binding of only one \gls{cacam}; it proceeds at much faster compared to first
step (rate $v_2$) ^[refer to image].  Once fully phosphorylated,
\gls{camkii} moves to PSD where it binds to NMDA receptor. In PSD, \gls{camkii}
is known to be protected from dephosphorylation
[@mullasseril_structural_2007] due to low concentration of phosphatase
\gls{pp1}.

Following Zhabotinksy, we assume that binding of \gls{cacam} is independent of
the state of other subunits, and there is no difference between $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ isomers of \gls{camkii}.  The activation of subunit by Ca^++^
follows a Hill equation [@zhabotinsky_bistability_2000].

    \begin{aligned}
        v_1 &= k_1 \left(\frac{\CaHILL ^3}{ 1 + \CaHILL ^ 3 }\right) ^2 \\
        v_2 &= k_1 \frac{\CaHILL ^3}{ 1 + \CaHILL ^ 3 } 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Dephosphorylation of \gls{camkii} holoenzyme and single subunit follows
Michaelis-Menten scheme (reaction @reac:dephosphorylation ).
