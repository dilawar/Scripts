# NAME: FFTDECONVOL 
# 
# PURPOSE: To perform deconvolution on an image in the frequency domain.
# 
# DESCRIPTION: FFTDECONVOL perform deconvolution on an image in the frequency
# domain using a filter image and an estimate of the noise to signal power
# ratio. Two inputs are required. The convolved image and a grayscale spatial
# domain convolution filter. Both the convolved image and the grayscale
# spatial domain convolution filter are transformed to the frequency domain
# using +fft. Then the fft of the image is divided by the fft of the filter
# and the product is then returned to the spatial domain using +ift. Since the
# filter may have noise, which will get amplified by the division when the
# signal is near zero, a small constant, representing the noise to signal
# power ratio is added to the denominator prior to the division in order to
# avoid a division by zero. Any alpha channel on the filter will be removed
# automatically before processing. If the image has an alpha channel it will
# not be processed, but simply copied from the input to the output. This is 
# useful only for deconvolving an image that has been blurred by the same 
# convolution.
# 
# OPTIONS: 
# 
# -n noise ... NOISE is the estimate of the small constant added to the
# denominator in the division process and represents the noise to signal power
# ratio. Values are floats>=0. Usually, one simply uses trial an error with an
# arbitrary small value for the noise, typically, in the range of about 0.001 
# to 0.0001. However, it can be estimated from the variance of a nearly  
# constant section of the image (to get the noise variance) divided by an 
# estimate of the variance of the whole image (to get the signal variance). 
# Values are floats>=0. The default=0
# 
# The filter image must be appropriately centered and padded with black to 
# the same size as the input image.
# 
# REQUIREMENTS: IM version 6.5.4-7 or higher, but compiled with HDRI enabled 
# in any quantum level of Q8, Q16 or Q32. Also requires the FFTW delegate 
# library.
# 
# LIMITATIONS: This script works well only with even, square images. Otherwise,   
# the FFT will pad them with black to conform. However, there will be excessive 
# ringing due to the color discontinuity associated with the padding. This 
# even, square limitation is a ramification of the current IM implementation 
# that needs addressing at some future time. It is not a limitation of FFTW.
# 
# See http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/fourier_transforms/fourier.html 
# for more details about the Fourier Transform with ImageMagick.
# 
# CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, 
# nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and 
# foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
