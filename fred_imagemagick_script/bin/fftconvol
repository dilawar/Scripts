# NAME: FFTCONVOL 
# 
# PURPOSE: To perform convolution on an image in the frequency domain.
# 
# DESCRIPTION: FFTCONVOL performs convolution on an image in the frequency
# domain using a filter image. Two inputs are required. The image and a
# grayscale spatial domain convolution filter. Both the image and the grayscale
# spatial domain filter are transformed to the frequency domain using +fft.
# Then the Fourier transform of the filter is multiplied with the fft of the 
# image and the product is then returned to the spatial domain using +ift. 
# Any alpha channel on the filter will be removed automatically before 
# processing. If the image has an alpha channel it will not be processed, but 
# simply copied from the input to the output.
# 
# OPTIONS: 
# 
# No options are required
# 
# The filter image must be appropriately centered and padded with black to 
# the same size as the input image.
# 
# REQUIREMENTS: IM version 6.5.4-7 or higher, but compiled with HDRI enabled 
# in any quantum level of Q8, Q16 or Q32. Also requires the FFTW delegate 
# library.
# 
# LIMITATIONS: This script works well only with even, square images. Otherwise,   
# the FFT will pad them with black to conform. However, there will be excessive 
# ringing due to the color discontinuity associated with the padding. This 
# even, square limitation is a ramification of the current IM implementation 
# that needs addressing at some future time. It is not a limitation of FFTW.
# 
# See http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/fourier_transforms/fourier.html 
# for more details about the Fourier Transform with ImageMagick.
# 
# CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, 
# nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and 
# foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
